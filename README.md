### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

‚Ä¢	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
‚Ä¢	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
‚Ä¢	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
‚Ä¢	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúWhat should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?‚Äù Generated Context:
‚Ä¢	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
‚Ä¢	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

## ALGORITHM: Scenario-Based Report: AI-Powered Chatbot Prompting Techniques
üéØ Scenario

A company has deployed an AI chatbot for customer support. The chatbot needs to efficiently resolve product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiry issues while being conversational and adaptive.

1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

Goal: Compare two or more options.

Example Prompt:
"Compare how the chatbot handles order tracking vs. product troubleshooting in terms of customer satisfaction and efficiency."

GPT-5 Output:

Order tracking queries are resolved faster (avg. 1‚Äì2 turns) due to structured data.

Product troubleshooting requires multi-turn clarification, leading to longer sessions but deeper engagement.

Gemini Output:

Order tracking: high accuracy, quick responses, but limited personalization.

Troubleshooting: engaging conversation, but sometimes leads to escalation if issue is complex.

Evaluation:
Both tools agree on speed vs. depth tradeoff. GPT-5 emphasizes turn efficiency, while Gemini highlights personalization.

2. Experiential Perspective Prompt

Goal: Generate responses from a ‚Äúfirst-person‚Äù or ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù view.

Example Prompt:
"Imagine you are a customer who tried using the chatbot for a delivery delay issue. Share your experience."

GPT-5 Output (as customer):
‚ÄúI asked about my late order. The chatbot quickly pulled my order ID, told me the delivery status, and even offered SMS updates. It felt smooth, like chatting with a support agent.‚Äù

Gemini Output (as customer):
‚ÄúI used the chatbot when my order was delayed. It was easy to use, but it took a while to understand my exact problem. Once it did, I got the delivery update, but I wished it had apologized.‚Äù

Evaluation:
GPT-5 focuses on efficiency & positive flow, Gemini stresses empathy gaps.

3. Everyday Functioning Prompt

Goal: Show how chatbot fits into routine tasks.

Example Prompt:
"How does the chatbot assist a busy customer managing multiple deliveries daily?"

GPT-5 Output:

Tracks multiple order IDs at once

Provides delivery windows in one message

Sets automated reminders

Gemini Output:

Good for managing 1‚Äì2 deliveries, but struggles when too many IDs are input

Works best when integrated with calendar notifications

Evaluation:
GPT-5 highlights scalability, Gemini notes limitations in bulk usage.

4. Universal Prompt

Goal: Make the chatbot respond in a universally accessible way.

Example Prompt:
"Explain the chatbot‚Äôs order tracking feature in a way that a child, an adult, and a senior can all understand."

GPT-5 Output:

Child: ‚ÄúThe chatbot tells you where your toy package is.‚Äù

Adult: ‚ÄúIt gives real-time delivery status for your order.‚Äù

Senior: ‚ÄúIt helps you know when your parcel will reach your home.‚Äù

Gemini Output:

Child: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like asking your friend where your gift is.‚Äù

Adult: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a customer support tool to track your shipment.‚Äù

Senior: ‚ÄúIt provides updates about the parcel so you don‚Äôt need to call the shop.‚Äù

Evaluation:
Both simplify language well. GPT-5 uses clear role-based phrasing, Gemini uses relatable analogies.

5. Structures Prompt Refinements

Goal: Improve clarity by structuring prompts step by step.

Example Prompt:
"Step 1: Ask user for order ID. Step 2: Confirm order details. Step 3: Provide status. Step 4: Offer SMS updates."

GPT-5 Output:
Follows structure sequentially, with numbered messages.

Gemini Output:
Maintains structure but merges steps (asks for ID and confirms in one step).

Evaluation:
GPT-5 sticks to strict structured flow, Gemini optimizes for fewer steps.

6. Prompt Size Limitations

Goal: Test chatbot‚Äôs performance when prompts are long or short.

Example Prompt:

Short Prompt: ‚ÄúTrack my order.‚Äù

Long Prompt: ‚ÄúI recently ordered a smartphone case last Friday evening, and I haven‚Äôt received it yet. Could you please check the shipment details, expected delivery timeline, and also notify me if there are any possible delays?‚Äù

GPT-5 Output:

Short Prompt: ‚ÄúPlease provide your order ID.‚Äù

Long Prompt: Identifies product type, order timeline, asks for ID, and prepares detailed response.

Gemini Output:

Short Prompt: Same as GPT-5.

Long Prompt: Breaks the query into smaller sub-questions before responding.

Evaluation:
GPT-5 handles long prompts holistically, Gemini breaks them into chunks for clarity.

## RESULT:
Technique	GPT-5 Strengths	Gemini Strengths
Comparative Analysis	Efficiency-focused insights	Personalization-focused insights
Experiential Perspective	Smooth experience narration	Emphasizes empathy gaps
Everyday Functioning	Scalable solutions	Notes real-world limits
Universal Prompt	Clear role-based responses	Relatable analogies
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
